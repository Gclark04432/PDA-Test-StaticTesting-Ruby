### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

#dif should be 'def' to declare a new function in Ruby
#the multiple parameters passed to the function should also be separated by a , in the function signature
#line 23 returns 'card' however should be 'card1' as 'card' is not defined anywhere in the scope of this function
#There is an 'end' statement on line 29 that should not be there
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
